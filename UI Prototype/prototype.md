# Viewing/Using the Prototype
- Anyone can view the prototype by clicking on the above link.
- If you are not on this team you can ONLY view it. Only team members have edit access.
- To actually use the prototype you can click the present/play button in the top right.
- It is only a prototype though so it has very little functionality actually implemented. The only things you can actually click on are the "Search for Faculty" buttons to take you to the opposite pages.
