- What went well? The remote machine has been working well for the most part and it is nice being able to have us all work in the exact same environment.
- What didn’t go so well? The up to date CSS files still dont get compiled. I think it is just an issue of working on a remote machine and there is not much we can do to help it.
- What have I learned? I have continually been learning more about Linux which is big and interacting with the client and learning how to understand their problems.
- What still puzzles me? Still brainstorming a way to have the CSS files compiled correctly.
- What will we change to improve? We no longer are able to use the SSO so now we will be creating a mockup login system.

# Brian
- What went well? Webscrapping the BGSU faculty database went smoothly.
- What didn’t go so well? Uploading the CV data into an HTML text box is a little more involved than I anticipated.
- What have I learned? I've learned that simple tasks aren't always easy.
- What still puzzles me? How to format the names scrapped from the BGSU database so they correspond to names taken from CVs
- What will we change to improve? We will hopefully find a good way to compare names in our lookup file.
