# Will
- What went well? We were able to connect and format the update page where faculty can upload their information. THis way we dont have to upload every faculty members cv/information before the site is hosted. We also added some formatting to the results page.
- What didn’t go so well? Having trouble with our environments so I can't fully run the webapp still. Hoping our virtual machine helps with this.
- What have I learned? How to acceept files from a user in html and working with forms. Also have been elarning more about the backend side from Anthony.
- What still puzzles me? Trying to figure out how to connect the VM to pycharm since it does't have a GUI.
- What will we change to improve? Will get the VM all set up hopefully to use an ssh session with it from pycharm. 

# Brian
- What went well? Extracting the department name from a CV turned out nicely and generalized fairly well
- What didn’t go so well? Improving Research Interest extraction is still a challenge and my frequency approach used in department name extraction didn't work so well in this use case
- What have I learned? I consistent way to text mine data when you already know expected values in a text field
- What still puzzles me? How to apply this same logic to less expected values (i.e. research interests fields)
- What will we change to improve? I will try to improve this by collecting a dataset of research interests by scraping popular papers from selected websites

# Anthony
- What went well? Made lots of requested changes from the client.
- What didn’t go so well? Struggled with making all interests showup for a search result.
- What have I learned? I got more practice with using the django template language and learned how to create custom functions we can use.
- What still puzzles me? How to remove past databases from django.
- What will we change to improve? Try to work ahead of time instead of crunching at the last minute.
