# Will
- What went well? We were able to set up the development environment in the VM pretty quickly to our surprise which was very good. We ended up pulling the project into out individual directories in t he VM, moutning th remote directories onto our harddrives, and then setting up the interpretter in Brians remote repository.
- What didn’t go so well? There were some bugs that came along with transitioning to the VM main with file paths we had hard coded into the project. We were able to figure those out though. We also had some issues installing the mysql client in our interpretter, but eventually worked through that.
- What have I learned? I have learned more about ssh, linux VMs, sftp software (mounting remote directories), and using PyCharm.
- What still puzzles me? Since the interpretter is used via ssh on the machine im not sure we actually need to have the project files on the VM. I think they could be local, but it is working so no complaints.
- What will we change to improve? Regarding the environment we still need to finish up the database and some small bugs. With the project we will need to set up the SSO and give the user the option to search for people and departments. 

# Brian
- What went well? Getting the environment set up on linux and accessing it locally went better than expected
- What didn’t go so well? There were plenty of bugs and problem solving that needed to be done to get everything set up, but it wasn't that bad
- What have I learned?  I've learned a bit of linux and more about networking
- What still puzzles me? Nothing yet
- What will we change to improve? We have to do the issues that we wanted to do this week in the next sprint, since setting up the environment took so much time

# Anthony
- What went well? Working as a team we were able to get the virtual environment up and running for everyone in the team.
- What didn’t go so well? The setup for the vm is not the cleanest and could definitely use some changes.
- What have I learned? I got better with using the cmd line in a linux virtual machine.
- What still puzzles me? We used tunnelling to forward a port on the vm but I'm not exactly sure how it works.
- What will we change to improve? We will need to do our best to catch up on our issues cause we a bit behind due to the vm setup.

# Jacob
- What went well? the virtual environment was set up for everyone
- What didn’t go so well? a person from the university that was supposed to contact me never did
- What have I learned? we got better at using virtual machines
- What still puzzles me? still figuring out some of the specifics of it
- What will we change to improve? continue to clean up miscellanious things with the project
