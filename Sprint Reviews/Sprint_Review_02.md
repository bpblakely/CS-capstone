- What went well? I wa able to clean up the figma prototype to look a lot nicer and less empty with some interactive overlays. I was then able to make the first HTML/CSS templates for the home and results page. The results page will need to be changed to dyanmically provide data from the DB.
- What didn’t go so well? I had never used HTML/CSS before so there was a learning curve to that which took up quite a bit of my time. 
- What have I learned? The basics of HTML/CSS.
- What still puzzles me? I'm not exactly sure how to add advanced animations to html templates and will need to look into that. I'm also not sure how to progress on the Results page template until we get data (and know what data we will be providing).
- What will we change to improve? We will need to look into accessibility requirements that BGSU may have for guidelines. We also may need to change the CSS to be more adaptable to different screens.

# Brian
- What went well? 
    - Getting the research interest data out of a CV was fairly easy
- What didn’t go so well? 
    - Figuring out a way to intelligently gather the most relevant information on a CV. I concluded the best way is too complicated to implement in our scope of time.
- What have I learned?
    - I learned that trying to accept all forms of input is impossible and I should stick to a large, strict set of formatting rules that a CV should follow
- What still puzzles me?
    - I'm still unsure of a good set of rules to follow to extract other information such as publication information.
- What will we change to improve?
    - We will figure out a clear way to reduce complexity in this part of the program, so our work doesn't stagnate and a future group could continue our work in the future. 

# Anthony 
- What went well? Once we were able to get the csv files into the correct format it was quite easy to actually upload it to the database.
- What didn't go so well? There was a lot of difficulty in trying to get the data read in from the csv files to the correct format in order to upload it to the database.
- What have I learned? I learned about reading csv files using Panda and then uploading that information through Django's database tools.
- What still puzzles me? I am still puzzled by the process of manipulating the csv files to produce the information to upload it the database. I was able to complete it with the help of Brian but I don't fully understand the process.
- What will we change to improve? To improve I will do more research on Django's database tools. We got stuck for a while just because we didn't realize Django had it's own database tools and were trying to use a mySQL library.
