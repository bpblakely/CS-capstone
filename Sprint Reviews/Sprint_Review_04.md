# Will
- What went well? Our meeting with our customer (Dr. Lee) went well I thought. He seemed generally pleased and provided good articulte feedback for things for me to change on the frontend. It was easy to end the button for updating information to the nav bar which was good.
- What didn’t go so well? My environment for the Django project with PyCharm hasn't been running well. There are issues with my local environment that I am still working through which have made development more difficult.
- What have I learned? This week I learned more about implementing forms for text input and file input from the user. I have also been learning more about virtual environment and pycharm.
- What still puzzles me? Still working through some bugs with PyCharm. I am also still trying to figure out how to implement BGSU SSO and how to only allow faculty to upload information.
- What will we change to improve? Implement user stories/requirements our customer asked for, implement more accessibility standards, and continue to refine our project. It would also help for us to consistently find time to all work together.

# Brian
- What went well? Our customer was okay with our group simplifying the process of searching the database, which is what we hoped for.
- What didn’t go so well? Like Will, my Django environment is still being strange and won't fully compile the webserver on my local machine. This makes it difficult to work independently on implementing features on the website.
- What have I learned? I've learned that even with the exact same environment set up, it is still challenging to get different machines to run code in the exact same way.
- What still puzzles me? I'm still a bit puzzled on the environment, but also if the text preprocessing to extract stop words is needed if we are going to stick to substring matching for searching the database.
- What will we change to improve? Get on Dr. Lee's case about the virtual desktop until he gets it set up, since it will significantly increase the groups productivity.

# Anthony
- What went well? We were quickly able to solve the issue of multiple interests displaying incorrectly on the results page.
- What didn’t go so well? We struggled to find a good time to setup a meeting with Dr. Lee but in the end we got it figured out.
- What have I learned? I have learned about using django/python code embeded within html.
- What still puzzles me? HTML is still difficult to read and understand for me but as we continue working with it my skills seem to be improving.
- What will we change to improve? To improve we are trying to be more proactive with setting up meetings with Dr. Lee and trying to get him in class so we can all attend the meetings.

# Jacob
- What went well? Nothing
- What didn’t go so well? it turns out that sso sign in integration will be a lot more complicated then we thought it would be
- What have I learned? N/A this week
- What still puzzles me? sso integration as a whole seems complex and will take a while to figure out
- What will we change to improve? We will reach out to bgsu staff for assistence in integrating this
