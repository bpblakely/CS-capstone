# Will
- What went well? Converting the units was very easy using rem units. We were also made quite a bit of progress in adding functionality to the site with searching key words and retrieving results.
- What didn’t go so well? The client will want the site to work for mobile devices which I now have realized we will most likely need to make seperate templates for.
- What have I learned? I have learned more about building backends with django and rem units. 
- What still puzzles me? How I will go about developing mobile templates and how to detect someone is om mobile.
- What will we change to improve? We in the future will have the optimize the database and I will have to continue to dabble with the CSS.

# Brian
- What went well? We figured out how to use Django a little more properly, which has significantly helped us in connecting search functionalities to our database.
- What didn’t go so well? This week we got four more CV's, but only two of them got correctly parsed using the current text mining code. Even the most simple parts of a CV have a ton of variation.
- What have I learned? I've learned that it's better to write text mining code to be as generic as possible, but more importantly make the user be responsible for assuring the data is correct.
- What still puzzles me? We are still working on trying to get a form upload feature. We also still don't know how to connect BGSU's SSO connection to our web app yet either.
- What will we change to improve? We will try to find a better a more productive way to work as a team.

# Anthony 
- What went well? Due to the snow day on Tuesday we were all able to meet as a team and work digilently on our project for a good 3-4 hours. This allowed us to get a lot of work done and get caught up on our project.
- What didn't go so well? We spent most of our time figuring out how to display the search data on the webpage. It was a roadblock that took up most of our worktime together.
- What have I learned? I learned how to display data gathered from our database and show it on the webpage using django and html.
- What still puzzles me? I am still puzzled by Django's built in SQL library. We were trying to use SQL queries but Django seems to have built in functions that can make working with the database easier if used properlly.
- What will we change to improve? To improve we will try to make more time to work as a group as things went really well with everyone being available at the same time to work.
