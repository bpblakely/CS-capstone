# Will
- What went well? Have begun using winscp and putty to work on the okay which has gone okay so far. Not as user friendly as pycharm though, since I have to use multiple apps.
- What didn’t go so well? Has been hard to connect with one another to work together between all of our schedules. Part of this is that we are coming to the end of the semester when class work piles up
- What have I learned? I keep learning more and more about html and css which is a huge benefit. I have gone from know frontend experience to quite a bit this semester.
- What still puzzles me? The latency issue with file uploads in pycharm for css files. 
- What will we change to improve? Try and connect/meet up to pair program more. We are also hoping we can implement a mock login using django's system.
