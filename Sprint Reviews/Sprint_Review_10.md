# Will
- What went well? Winscp with a putty terminal has been going well. I use vscode as my default editor and can run the server with the runserver command.
- What didn’t go so well? Have been having trouble implementing both my user stories. Other issues have come up that were more important and did not allow me to finish. It has also been difficult to make a dropdown sections. 
- What have I learned? I have learned more about SFTP and SSH tech. I also continue to learn more and more about frontend development.
- What still puzzles me? How to design and create the drop down section I am envisioning.
- What will we change to improve? Will put research interests into an unordered list hopefully by the end of the week.
