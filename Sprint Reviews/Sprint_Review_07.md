# Will
- What went well? Implementing the dropdown menu functionality went quicker then expected and is now fully functional.
- What didn’t go so well? My development environemnt does not compile the most recently saved CSS files for some reason. I am thinking about hosting the repo locally and see if that fixes it.
- What have I learned? How to implement dropdown menus and use them with search bars.
- What still puzzles me? How we will do the logging in without the SSO exactly. We just need a basic proof of concept.
- What will we change to improve? Adding the logging in and putting results from PDF scraping in the text boxes for users to change.

# Brian

- What still puzzles me? Nothing
- What will we change to improve? We will add a login button to replace the SSO functionality. 

# Anthony
- What went well? We were able to complete all of our issues this week and got some major functionality implemented.
- What didn’t go so well? We were late getting started this sprint and seems we put ourselves in a crunch towards the end.
- What have I learned? I was able to improve upon how we operate our local machines alongside the vm which has saved a lot of time. I also learned how radial buttons are implemented.
- What still puzzles me? The vm is still a delicate machine and seems to explode in our faces sometimes but slowly getting better with it.
- What will we change to improve? Hopefully get an earlier start on our work so we aren't in a crunch at the end.
