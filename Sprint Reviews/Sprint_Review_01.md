- What went well? Figma worked good. It had been a little bit since I used to it but was easy to pick back up, and I thought Jacob did good for not using it previously. Also BGSU's documentation for web design came in very handy. We have all the necessary aspects of site on the prototype.
- What didn’t go so well? I wanted to keep our fonts consistent with BGSU web guidelines but Figma doesn't carry any of them so we will have to implement those when we actually build the UI. Also the prototype is very barebones and feels a little empty compared to other BGSU pages so I might brainstorm ways to fill it in a bit. It was also hard to consistently meet up to work with schedule conflicts.
- What have I learned? I have learned some of the basics of the BGSU web guidelines from their documentation and browsing through the different sites. I have also learned Figma more and using it in tandem with another person.
- What still puzzles me? I have not worked much with HTML much so it'll be interesting to see how similar the final product and the prototype will look. The two teams this week (UI and database) have also worked very separately so I don't know much about what progress Brian and Anthony have made.
- What will we change to improve? Hopefully we will be able to find consistent times to meet up and work and I think our sprint planning will become more efficient as the semester goes by.

# Brian
- What went well? Creating the MySQL database using command line was pretty simple. Inserting data was easy simple too.
- What didn’t go so well? Connecting a custom made MySQL database to Django/Python instead of using Python/Django to construct the database. 
- What have I learned? It will probably be easier to work with MySQL through Python directly, rather than using strictly MySQL.
- What still puzzles me? I'm still wondering if it's better to create the MySQL database then interface that using Python and Django or just avoid creating a database manually. I'm not sure if using Python and Django to handle all the database operations will be a crutch in the future.
- What will we change to improve? Investigate how to connect to the Django made database using MySQL inline commands. If I can figure this out, then we will be able to make modifications to the database directly and still have the convenience of the premade Django functions.

# Anthony
- What went well? Selecting MySQL and Django as our framework seems to have been a good choice. Django supports MySQL and was able to easily connect to my local database without much effort. 
- What didn’t go so well? I struggled to commit the proper files necessary to run the Django backend. I also ran into an issue with try to reading the data from the database that was causing the webpage to crash when trying to access it. This was a simple mistake but to a while to figure out due to my limited Python knowledge at this point.
- What have I learned? I have never worked with a local database so going through the process of getting one setup was a challenge but a welcome one. I also have very limited experience with Python and to add to that I have zero experience with Django so everything done to connect the database with the project was a learning experience.
- What still puzzles me? MySQL is a weak-point for myself and will take a lot of practice to get better with. I need to do some research on how to read from a file to insert the scrapped CV data into the database.
- What will we change to improve? I will take more time learning how to use MySQL and Django instead of jumping in blind and trying to learn through trial by fire. I will also use the resources of my teammates more often as Brian showed me that while my SQL is limited working together allowed us to come up with a solution much quicker.

# Jacob
- What went well? Figma worked to sastifaction. It is user friendly and easy to handle
- What didn’t go so well? Nothing really.
- What have I learned? Ive learned how to use figma in this and did some refining
- What still puzzles me? a few of the more advanced things in regards to Figma
- What will we change to improve? Id say we only need to tweak a few minor things down the road
